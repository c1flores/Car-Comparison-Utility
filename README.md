## Overview

This utility helps you decide which car is a better buy by comparing the total cost of ownership for two cars over a 10-year period. It takes into account the purchase price and fuel efficiency of each car, as well as the cost of fuel over the given time frame.

<br />

## What is the Car Comparison Utility

You have the choice of buying one of two cars. One is more fuel efficient than the other, but also more expensive. You plan to keep the car for ten years. You know the price and fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon, mpg) of both cars. Assume a price of $4 per gallon of gas and usage of 15,000 miles per year. You will pay cash for the car and not worry about financing costs. Which car is the better deal?
