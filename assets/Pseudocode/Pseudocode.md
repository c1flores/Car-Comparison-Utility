# Car Comparison Utility Script Pseudocode
This pseudocode outlines a script for comparing the total cost of ownership between two cars over a 10-year period.

<br   />

## Objectives
- Compare the total cost of ownership between two cars over a 10-year period
- Use a data-driven approach to determine which car is more cost-effective
- Provide a recommendation based on the comparison results

<br   />

## Meta-Analysis of Approach

### Big Picture: Develop a script that assists users in making informed decisions regarding car ownership by analyzing cost factors


<br   />

### Define a class for the Car Comparison Utility
```
START:

CLASS CarComparison
```


<br   />

### Define the main function to execute the utility
```
METHOD Main():

    // Define information for Car 1
    SET price1 to 25000.0
    SET efficiency1 to 50.0
    
    // Define information for Car 2
    SET price2 to 20000.0
    SET efficiency2 to 30.0
    
    // Define constants
    SET pricePerGallon to 4.0
    SET annualMilesDriven to 15000
    SET numYears to 10
    
    // Calculate the total cost for each car
    SET totalCost1 to CalculateTotalCost(price1, efficiency1, pricePerGallon, annualMilesDriven, numYears)
    SET totalCost2 to CalculateTotalCost(price2, efficiency2, pricePerGallon, annualMilesDriven, numYears)
    
    // Compare the total costs and provide a recommendation
    IF totalCost1 is less than totalCost2 THEN
        PRINT "Choose car 1."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Choose car 2."
```


<br   />

### Define a method to calculate the total cost of ownership
```
METHOD CalculateTotalCost(purchasePrice, fuelEfficiency, pricePerGallon, annualMilesDriven, numYears) -> double:

    // Calculate annual fuel consumed
    SET annualFuelConsumed to annualMilesDriven divided by fuelEfficiency
    
    // Calculate annual fuel cost
    SET annualFuelCost to pricePerGallon times annualFuelConsumed
    
    // Calculate operating cost over the given number of years
    SET operatingCost to numYears times annualFuelCost
    
    // Return the sum of the purchase price and the operating cost
    RETURN purchasePrice plus operatingCost
```

<br   />

### Finalize the class definition
```
ENDCLASS
